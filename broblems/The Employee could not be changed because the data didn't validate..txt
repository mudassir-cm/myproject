     same probleb in case of following

1) creating modelform of two models model name is svaping to each other or wrong model set in meta class of ModelForm class

2) forget to give the "name attribute in input tag" error <input value="{{ obj.name }}">sol <input name="name" value="{{ obj.name }}"> 

3) when you use ModelForm class to update data of model you must specify 
   all fields of model in form when you set "fields = '__all__" in meta class  

      other than this ValueError is come (The Employee could not be changed because the data didn't validate.)
